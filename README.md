so with this assignment all the bootstrap i used was for my 'nav-bar'. 

i also created seperate css files for each individual html file instead of usind a index.htm i save under a bio.html. 

as for porfolio i did not have any real projects made so i added a some pictures that you can click threw some from Kauai. and one from the seattle area. 
all htmls are responsive. 

as for my pictures i tried to create a file to store them all in but even after i changed the href they still wouldnt show up
